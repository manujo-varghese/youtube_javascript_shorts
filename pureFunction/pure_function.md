In JavaScript, a pure function is a function that returns the same output for a given set of inputs, and does not have any side effects. This means that the function does not modify any variables outside its scope, does not cause any side effects such as network or database operations, and does not depend on any state that can change. The output of a pure function depends solely on its arguments and does not rely on any external state or mutable data.
